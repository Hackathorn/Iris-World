## Contact

I am happy to answer questions! Just write me an [email](mailto:mail@sebastianraschka.com)
or consider asking the question on the [Google Groups Email List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-machine-learning-book).

If you are interested in keeping in touch, I have quite a lively twitter stream ([@rasbt](https://twitter.com/rasbt)) all about data science and machine learning. I also maintain a [blog](http://sebastianraschka.com/articles.html) where I post all of the things I am particularly excited about.

### What's Next

- [SciPy 2016](http://scipy2016.scipy.org/ehome/index.php?eventid=146062&tabid=332930&) in Austin, Texas is coming up soon. I am really excited to teach the [scikit-learn tutorial session](https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ehome/146062/332960/) with [Andreas Mueller](http://amueller.github.io/) on July 12th this year! I am looking forward to seeing & meeting you all there!
- I have received a bunch of emails lately, and YES, I am really looking forward to writing a new book! Deep learning is the topic that excites me most at the moment, but I think that building up the math background in an interesting, engaging way may be time well spent?! I've been brainstorming lately, and a "Think Machine Learning" series may be a cool idea. I am planning to write about calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, statistics, and all the other puzzle pieces to assemble the big picture: Deep learning. So, stay tuned while I am [getting started!](https://leanpub.com/ml-precalc) :)
